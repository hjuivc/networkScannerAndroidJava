## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our software, we encourage you to report it to us as soon as possible.

Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **Contact Us**: Send an email to [oc2c1g6b@duck.com](mailto:oc2c1g6b@duck.com) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Include steps to reproduce, if possible. Any additional information, like affected versions and potential impacts, would be highly appreciated.

2. **Expectations**: After reporting a vulnerability, you can expect to receive an acknowledgement of your report within 48 hours. We will review your report and may contact you for further information.

3. **Follow-Up**: We will keep you informed of the progress we make towards addressing the vulnerability. This includes an initial assessment, decisions on any necessary updates, and the eventual resolution of the issue.

4. **Disclosure**: We aim to be transparent about security issues. Once a vulnerability has been confirmed and a fix is available, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability in an appropriate manner. However, we ask that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been resolved.

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.
