# networkScannerAndroidJava

Learning Android development by creating a network scanner similar to nmap with Android Studio and Java.

## Introduction

This project aims to serve as a learning journey into Android app development using Android Studio and Java. As part of this endeavor, I will be building a network scanner application inspired by the functionalities of nmap. This project will not only help me gain proficiency in Android development but also provide a practical understanding of network scanning techniques and Android platform capabilities.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is educational. By creating a network scanner app, I aim to:

- **Learn Android Development**: Gain hands-on experience with Android Studio, Java programming, and Android SDK.
- **Explore Networking Concepts**: Understand network scanning techniques, network discovery, and data transmission on Android devices.
- **Apply Software Engineering Practices**: Utilize GitHub features such as issues, pull requests, actions, projects, and wiki to manage the project and collaborate with others.
- **Implement Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**: Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment processes. This includes running tests through CI/CD, security scans, and ensuring code quality with each commit.
- **Document and Share Knowledge**: Create comprehensive documentation, including this README file, to share insights, project progress, and learnings with others in the community.

## Features

- Network scanning functionality to discover available hosts, open ports, and network services.
- Intuitive user interface for initiating and viewing scan results.
- Integration with GitHub features for project management, collaboration, and version control.
- Continuous integration and deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- Security scans and best practices implementation to ensure the app's integrity and user data safety.

## How to Contribute

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced developer willing to share knowledge, there are many ways to contribute:

1. **Issue Reporting**: Report bugs, suggest enhancements, or share ideas by creating GitHub issues.
2. **Pull Requests**: Submit pull requests for bug fixes, feature implementations, or documentation enhancements.
3. **Code Reviews**: Participate in code reviews to provide feedback and improve code quality.
4. **Testing**: Help improve the app's reliability by testing new features and reporting any issues.
5. **Documentation**: Contribute to project documentation by updating README, wiki pages, or adding inline comments in the code.
